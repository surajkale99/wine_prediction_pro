Project Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using Machine Learning algorithms.
Wine quality is influenced by various factors such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and alcohol percentage. By applying ML models, we can analyze these features and accurately classify or predict wine quality scores.

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
